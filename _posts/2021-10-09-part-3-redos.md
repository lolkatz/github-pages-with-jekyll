That track was very interesting for me because I didn't knew what ReDoS was and it turns out it's pretty powerful. So ReDoS means [Regular expression Denial of Services](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS). Basically there is some kind of algorithm that will try to match a string with the regular expression by evaluating all the possible paths. So you craft a string that will not match the regular expression but that will have a lot of possibility for the algorithm to explore. 

Here is an example of a problematic regex, it must begin by a and end with a and the two plus will try to match themself repeatedly:
````
^(a+)+$
````
Using this string that we know won't work since it doesn't end with an A (and ! won't match with an alphabetical character either so I'll be reusing it in all my ReDoS) but nonetheless the algorithm will try every path before concluding there is no match:
````
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
````
I used the website [regex 101](https://regex101.com/), it's very convenient and explain every part of the the regex. I usually find Regular expression hard to read and I do not tend to use them but it can be useful in some case like validating email and phone number. Turns out there is [ReDoS in some default regex used for validation in ASP.NET MVC](http://blog.malerisch.net/2015/09/net-mvc-redos-denial-of-service-vulnerability-cve-2015-2526.html). Sounds interesting I'll have to check this out sometimes... But back to the ReDoS tracks.

## ReDoS 1: Introduction to ReDoS

So you are given a regex and you are told that you can only enter 8 characters in a console and you need to have more then 2000 iterations with the ReDoS. Here is the regex:
````
^(\w*)+$
````
And here is my first successful ReDoS:

## ReDoS 2: email validation

This one was funny so I'll just show you a picture of the challenge:

![ReDoS-mail-validation](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2021/redos2-mail-validation.png)

Reading the python script you realize that the intern has no idea what the regex he is working on is used for:

````python
import re

regex = r'^(?P<firstWord>\w+)(?P<followingWords>\.\w+)*(?P<extention>\+\w+)?@(?P<subdomain>\w+)(?P<higherLevelDomains>.\w+)+$'

# firstWord: Match un premier "mot" [A-z0-9]
# followingWords: Comme beaucoup de monde mettent plusieurs mots séparés par un ., on tente d'en matcher plusieurs.
# extention: Dans notre dataset, j'ai vu des addresse qui ressemblaient à ça: addresse+unMot@exemple.com aucune idée de ce que ça fait, mais faut le supporter.
# subdomain: On doit avoir un domaine initial
# higherLevelDomains: Et avoir au moins 1 domaine de plus haut niveau (séparé par un . à chaque fois)
````
The regex in the code is slightly different then what I was used to. First the r means raw string and is meant so that [python syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) doesn't interfere with regular expression syntax. Then there is the (?P<name>...) notation which I didn't quite took the time to understand, so I had to wing it without relying as much on regex101. I got lucky using this payload:
````
a@a.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
````
Anyway thank you intern!

## ReDoS 3: Coding interview

From the challenge description we know it's C++ source code. Here the python:
````python
import re

msg = input()
r = r'^(?P<import_statement>#import)((?P<lib> m[a-z]l{2,10}((?<=l{2})oc))|.);(?(lib)[A-z =]*|[0-9])+$'
re.match(r, msg)
````
I remembered there was a library called malloc so I tried this payload and it worked beyond my expectation:

![ReDoS 1 million](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2021/redos3-one-million.png)

I needed to do 64 thousand iterations and I did more then a million! 

![ReDoS3 catastrophe](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2021/redos3-catastrophe.png)

Seeing those red messages warning of catastrophe made me proud but there were other easiest challenges that I wanted to try. Next up: QR and cats!
