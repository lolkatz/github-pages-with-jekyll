The Throwback network on [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/room/throwback) simulate a realistic corporate Active Directory environment.
The scenario of the CTF is a red team penetration testing assignment, of which you are a member.
Since this network is segmented I will show how to pivot from the DMZ to the first domain.
